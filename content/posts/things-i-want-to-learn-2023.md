## Nix

I've been using Nix for almost one year now.
I started with Nix on Mac, then trying NixOS in
my old personal Macbook Pro 2015 model, which btw was running
Arch for a while.
Once getting a bit more used to NixOS, I started using NixOS full time professionally and personally for almost
6 months now.
However, my Nix knowledge is just like the tip ot the iceberg.
The two features I used the most:
* Nix as a package manager tool
* Nix-shell for development environment
