In exactly two weeks, it will be my one year anniversary at InDebted.
InDebted, [who won the best place to work in Australia in 2022](https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/workplace/why-indebted-is-australia-s-best-place-to-work-20220407-p5aboy#:~:text=Introducing%20a%20four-day%20week,BOSS%20Best%20Place%20to%20Work) is one of the first companies in Australia that offers four days working week as well as fully remote work.
As I have been working 4DWW for almost a year now, I want to reflect on this experience, mostly for my personal development, but also might be useful to someone else.

## The good ones

When I first started the job, it felt surreal. I never thought about it. I wasn't looking for that criteria at all. In fact, when the recruiter approached me, 4DWW wasn't even mentioned, until very last round of interview. So, when I got the job, I was like, that sounds really cool, imagine free time I will have, maybe I can work on a side hustle project or something.

#### Work-life balance

Without a doubt, I would say the most benefit of 4DWW is a great work-life balance.

Before that, I was always trying to have a decent work-life balance.
Working from home kinda helped a lot.
However, 4DWW does makes a big difference. Surprisingly, an extra day off is actually a whole lot of time. It's so much easier to organise outside of work appointments. I can have more quality time not just with family, and friends, but also for myself. I exercise more often. I just feel much better, physically and mentally.

#### Am I more productive at work?

In a short version, I would say YES. However, it's not that simple to tell at first.

In short terms, am I more happy at work? Probably yes? Do I get more stuff done? Unlikely. It would be lying if I said I can get as much work done as I would work 5 days a week.

However, when thinking about a span of 1 year period, it could be a different story.
* For the whole one year at InDebted, apart from the New Year holiday, I only took 1 annual leave (family business), and 1 personal (carer) leave. I never have that feeling of burnout like some of my previous roles. I don't feel like I need more rests. I have more than enough every week. I am just excited to be back on every single Monday. In contrast to my previous roles, I often used almost all the leaves I have to take rest in between busy weeks.

* All the works that I have done during this one year, there was **zero** bug, or any reworks required. This could be partially due to our engineering culture. But I would also argue that the fresh mind also help me to produce quality work overall.

## How's about the bad ones?

To be honest, I can't really think of any bad thing about 4DWW. Like, if you ask any employees, who would ever complain about it, right? ðŸ˜›

Although, one thing might potentially have a negative impact on my career would be working less meaning I might be progressing a bit slower than others who work their asses off.
Especially in techs where things evolve super fast, moving slow is just as bad as not moving.

## What's next?

4DWW is definitely a nice perk to have. However, it's not such a big deal breaker for me, at least not as much as remote working.
The main reason is that I have been enjoying doing what I am doing very much. "If you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life" as said by many.
I wouldn't mind working 5 days at all, as long as I can work from anywhere, and hours can be flexible enough to accommodate decent work-life balance.

In fact, very often, I do work overtime, either late night, or in the weekends, whenever I have some free time for myself.
I just enjoy working on the problems that still stuck in my head, doesn't matter it's my daytime job or personal projects.
